This cookbook provides support for installing the BrightBox builds of Ruby.

For more documentation on these builds, please see [the official brightbox documentation](http://blog.brightbox.co.uk/posts/next-generation-ruby-packages-for-ubuntu).

**Please Note:** If you're upgrading from an older version, the default action is to upgrade packages. To change this, you need to override `node['brightbox-ruby']['default_action']`.
